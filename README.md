# Network-Security
Developed a real-time IM service with Python, allowing clients to communicate in real-time.
Used Socket and Google Protocol Buffer to enable streamlined serialization and deserialization of messages.
Employed PyCryptodome for cryptographic operations and randomly generated IVs for each message.
Extended the IM service to support Encrypted IM by incorporating AES-256-CBC encryption and HMAC with SHA-256 authentication, providing secure and private communication for users.
